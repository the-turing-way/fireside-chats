*Thank you for joining us! We‚Äôre delighted to have you here.*



## üî• Propose a topic for a Fireside Chat

*Can‚Äôt join this event but want to get involved? Check out other ways of connecting with us: *[http://bit.ly/turingway](*http://bit.ly/turingway*)

We are looking for proposals for future discussions on *building cross-community collaborations, establishing context-specific support systems and working together towards global sustainability of the open infrastructure as part of this event series. Please propose your suggestion below or reach out to Malvika Sharan by emailing theturingway@gmail.com.*

- how to join forces between biology (wet lab scientists) and bioinformatics/statistics and other 'technical' services (research software engineers, etc)- to unsure reproducibility and open science principles are used throughout the whole research pipeline

## ‚Åâ Open Q \& A  

Questions to ask during the session



* What advice would you give early career researchers and others who want to work in open science?
    * Shern: (i) you're a human being with an impulse to share -- find the place that gives you freedom and safety to enjoy sharing what you do more openly! (ii) Reach out to people whose papers you liked and form human connections. (iii) Promote papers that have openly shared their science (inputs, data, workflows, whatever the discipline norm is) -- this can even be just pointing the fact out in group meetings (iv) and share your own science, and know that \_mistakes are normal and a part of learning\_ :)
    * Anelda: My advice would be to join a friendly community such as the Turing Way or OLS ([https://we-are-ols.org/](https://we-are-ols.org/) ) to learn more about the extent of open science. There are so many things you can do to start being more open. It's not all about sharing your data and scripts.
    * Pen: Agree with the others. Also that you don't have to do everything everywhere all at once. You could start with one or two small steps and go from there once your're comfortable. 
* What advice would the panelists give for funding bodies? (Everyone from government funding bodies, philanthropy, to smaller-scale grants)
    * Pen -- funders should make clear, explicit expectations of what they want to see (for example, funders should require people to submit a data management plan) AND follow up throughout the lifecycle of the project and check in with researchers in an encouraging (and not punitive) way
* A lot of work around Open Science may be funding under DEI-related funding streams - are there fears that the US government's closing of DEI programs at the federal level will have a chilling effect on open science funding worldwide?  
* Are there worries about the possibility of corporate capture of open science practices and organisations - given the possible decrease of interest and funding from government bodies?
*
