## ⁉ Open Q \& A  

*The zoom room will remain open from 14 :15- 14:30 UTC+1 for an open Q\&A. This part of the call will not be recorded, and is optional for both speakers and the audience.*

* How do you balance collective action and individual action? Self care vs collective care?
* How might this conversation shift during a time of global precarity?
* Do you think there's a connection between your personal context (age, country of residence, financial situation) and self-care? Is self-care a privilege sometimes?  Should kids learn the concept of self-care and collective care?
    * it is a human right!
    * Care as a luxury? (Answer was: it shouldn't be!)
    *

* What do you have to unlearn?
    * Chris: Passing the ball vs playing as a team. Flywheel: momentum, you know where you want to be in the future, but you know how you might want to get there. Change your environment and don't put that pressure on yourself to change immediately.
    * Mayya: In some communities, some people thrive, and the same person in other communities can be invalidated or somehow seen in a different way. I have to unlearn being perceived as experts, but sometimes we assume what is best for a team. Deconstructing what is implicit. Important to have diverse terms to make sure all voices are heard. 
    * Agnes: Coming from a research background, I've realised that it's okay to pause and reflect because sometimes it's just endless. Moving from victim to creator. Learning to delegate, or from institutional level.
    * Eirini: One way I have gone through unlearning is through burning out. But it stop me to think about what is important to me, but I think it's a little bit of a millenial capitalist thing to be really attached to your work and define your self worth by the work that you do... and that's just really harmful! d
    * Alan: That the system is messed up. Not necessarily myself. 
    * Patricia: Reading a lot and looking at the situations you are in... you may not t hink you are in a toxic environment, but you are. But I've been learning that i can see as a victi in one place, or can say I am the creator of my career and what I want to be.
        * Take away : "go elsewhere and create!"
* What do you do to reframe?
    * Agnes: Be "selfish"! I actively block out my time. 
        * MS: Slightly reframing that as self advocacy — that is so important to advocate for what working condition is not nurturing and brining along our colleagues in supporting us.
    * Chris: Acknowledge reciprocity, and the need for it exist. Sometimes this can be in personal or professional relations, and can be less detrimental.
    * Eirini: Also join a union!
    * Mayya: Focus and attention, and working on the policy level
        * just sharing for your interest [https://projects.tib.eu/remo/](https://projects.tib.eu/remo/) ReMO consortium
    * Alan: Interviews, etc. : It's not necessarly me who's in the spotlight in them. 
    * Agnes: We have sessions organised in my group every last Friday for these conversations with ECRs
    * Patricia: Saving time for exercise
    * Eirini: Get a pet! Give yourself permission!

## Feedback

What worked?

* Really enjoyed the topic and speakers' perspectives! Go 4-day workweek :)
*  
What didn’t work?

* 

* 

What would you change?

* Maybe offer a couple of templated approaches to self-assessment and next steps (though I had to go a little early; maybe this came later - apologies if so!)
* 

What surprised you?

* Lots of great big ideas, a few great concrete stories and examples (e.g. women's tea talks) - wondered if the balance might have been different, but also acknowledge it's hard to be vulnerable and share direct experiences (with others, with self) in such a setting sometimes

Agreed. I now look for ‘red flags’ when I’m talking to people about positions I might be interested in. Very much like in dating, signs of possible toxicity.

14:36:29 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

So important to do advocacy for change in teams and workplace. Part of unlearning in that is to understand when we push back.

Even some basic emotional intelligence would be nice in some workplaces. Some slight recognition.

14:46:39 From Laurel Ascenzi to Everyone:

I think what happens in academia translates to many of today's jobs. We have the privilege of being able to think about it, to talk about it, to overcome it. But also the responsibility to help other people in other settings to be able to put themselves first and prioritize their wellness and self-care.

I totally understand the instinct to call it selfish, though! We’re talking about completely reasonable things here, but when the expectations have been twisted so that we are expected to be available to everyone all the time, it’s hard to shake that feeling of guilt when we start setting (again, reasonable) boundaries. But a great step to reframe it to ourselves as not selfish, but something really positive.

I heard Cory Doctorow say the following the other day, when asked how come he is so productive with his writing: that he does not link inspiration to writing, that he doesn’t wait to be inspired or in the mood, or sat at a coffee place, to write. He just writes x number of pages per day, no matter the quality. And he also doesn’t add any ritual to it (example: to have a coffee next to him). And he mentioned something that made it click: we don’t expect the doctor we visit to think whether she is inspired to be a doctor that day or not, or the plumber to do the same, consider whether she is inspired to do plumbing.

15:13:01 From Zoe Wake Hyde to Everyone:

If we have only so much attention to give, and only so much time on this earth, we might want to think about reinfusing our attention and our communication with the intention that both deserve.”
