* Batool Almarzouq / Saudi / Twitter: @batool664
* Richard Dunks / Dallas, TX USA / @rdunks1 / tools, technologies, and social connections that enable common or otherwise shared activities while allowing various and dispersed activities to be better coordinated that are built using open source technologies that run on openly available data to the extent possible that are administered transparently and community governed with full accountability for all aspects of the endeavor (planning, management, operations, financing, and strategic planning)

Open infra then (in my mind) would be such structures that are also open to revision, reuse, change by users/those who want to set up their own.  Ideally open infrastructure should be independent (not run by the big hegemonic powers) and under community governance.

## ⁉ Open Q \& A  

* Has the session started? I'm still in the waiting room. Me as well :)  +1+1 Okay! just checking :) I am too! See link below!
* The link in the email doesn't work. The session has started: Might want to try [https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/96141741536?pwd=YlVKUlJiRjgvdm80RDU4WmsvaDBwdz09]([]https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/96141741536?pwd=YlVKUlJiRjgvdm80RDU4WmsvaDBwdz09[]) Thanks, will do. this works, thanks!
* Discussion around POSI - is it relevant here? I'd have thought so. [https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)
* Not sure if this was asked yet, as I joined late - could we talk about the resources necessary to run massive infrastructure? Water, power...


## 📝 Notes, comments and references by attendees

* Sarah Gibson:
    * Infrastructure = computational infrastructure
    * Open = open source contribution upstreaming
    * Desire to do open science isn't always possible to achieve - unburden reserachers to excell in their domain, provide supporting tools. => Colaboration building it.
    * Interactive computing is about the interface between a person and a computer
        * Part of this is having information that is both human and machine readable (semantic technologies)
    * Lillian Achom
        * Infrastructure = Community-owned telecoms. Physical telecoms, devices. Materials must be suitable and useful for broad community. 
        * Soroti first (?) 
        * I *love* Lillian's self-description as a 'Resilient Techprenuer' 
        * Low-cost services; anyone can connect to anyone regardless. Universal access.
    * Richard Dunks
        * Infrastructure = ? tools, technologies, and social connections that enable common or otherwise shared activities while allowing various and dispersed activities to be better coordinated that are built using open source technologies that run on openly available data to the extent possible that are administered transparently and community governed with full accountability for all aspects of the endeavor (planning, management, operations, financing, and strategic planning) (We have a draft investigation into this that we're revising and will be releasing in the near future)
        * Funding to create conditions where (?) can flourish. Help funders be good actors; strategic, thoughtful, sustainable. 
        * Viability means embedded in community. e.g. Open-source repo not enough.
        * Spends a lot of time in 'About' tabs on community sites -> place to learn about governance 
* Q - What's the goal?
        * Rayya.
            * Different goals. Can we agree on single definition of what it is?
            * Who's asking? Trace discourse around infra. 
            * Origins of 'infrastrucutre' — Military infrastructure: roads, highways. Into digital age.  ([https://twitter.com/AVastMachine/status/1382395605394235392)](https://twitter.com/AVastMachine/status/1382395605394235392))
            * Framing common to physical and digital: We hear about it when we're worried about it. Precarity, vulnerability.
        * Sarah
            * Alternative to return power to users. e.g. cloud platforms smilar to IICC, fully managed, etc. But customer doesn't have a voice in determining what it does. Provider may dump it. "Right to replicate" - right to transfer to other infra provider. Equal, delightful, experience. 
            * (See also: [https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/) )
        * Lillian
            * Q: Open hardware and networks, contrasted with open software? 
            * Real scenario: Had to install network infrastructure in rural community. Technical survey identified existing fibre and infra. Even to identify the owners of that existing infra was difficult. No access to information. Would have been a lot easier to do the job with that information and maximise based on what's already there. 
            * Cost-sensitive - need to prioritise funding for outcomes. Or cost-sharing.
            * Restricted devices, can't use different models of device in different contexts (networks?). Switches, routers, etc. Let manufacturers work with existing deployed infra. 
            * Open = Open to extension and integration
            * Software: Big telecoms providers are leaving people behind. Billing system shoudl be replicable, apply to different comunities. (Echoes of 2I2C 'right to replicate' ?)
* Q - two meanings of infra?
        * Richard
            * Infrastructure enables activities. Answer : what is it enabling? How critical to achieving that? How important is that objective? Analogues betwee 'road' type infra through to digital. 
            * Think about tools vs features. e.g. physical poles, switches are critical, unique, locally exclusive. But mobile devices are exchangeable. 
        * Sarah
            * provide compatible scaffolding, not computational infra itself. Provide the value-add over hardware, specialize it to the usage. 
            * Huge amounts of research data being generated. E.g. Pangea Forge pipeline, raw data into usage-ready format. Jupyter. Complete the circuit. * analysis-ready data, cloud-optimized (ARCO) formats*
* Q - if infra is only visible when it breaks, what causes breakages?
        * Anne
            * Even in specific cases, e.g. ARCO, you only notice when it breaks, it's the specialists who notice
        * Richard
            * Labour is important. SPOFs. Volunteer labour. Feels extractive. Critical work. Burnout.
        * Lillian
            * Raining interferes with connectivity! 
            * High cost, especially for communities. Last-mile. That part is often forgotten.
            * 68 USD for ?? MBps per month. We are requires to purchase 2 MBps (megabit per second?)
            * Connectivity is, itself, unreliable. Technical causes. 
        * Rayya
            * All aspects have pieces that break (community, technology, etc). Common concern is paying attention to points of breakage.
            * Innovation discourse doesn't talk about what didn't work.
            * Infrastructure discourse around maintenance and sustainability. 
                * Getting to the point where we can acknowledge breakage modes. Now becoming more apparent. 
            * There will always be breakages, but we're seeing an increase in noticing them.
* Q - what misconceptions exist about [open] infrastructure?
        * Lillian
            * People tend to think of software and data. But it should be thought of as all-round, start with physical infrastructure.
                * **Researchers and funders are more interested in data and software.**
                * How much focus is there on hardware in e.g. Uganda. e.g. 20 years' difference to more developed countries.
                * Hardware manufacturers. Whom do they consult? Users in developed countries?
                * Those in developing countries? Two different scenarios, two different needs. 
                * (Lillian's connection broke)
                * High time we paid attention to the whole picture. Hardware, software, different communities. 
            * Sarah
                * Complexity. People (direct users?) don't grasp how complex the deployed thing is. 
                * Jupyter org. Jypiter hub volunteer-led. 
                * Funding for feature development takes a lot of person-time. Grant funding cycle precarious. 
                * Features on laundry list for a long time. That may result in generic competition (mainstream cloud provdiers) being able to provide features. 
                * "Nothing about us without us". Global north" can't claim to provide solutions. Not long-term. Need to be thoughtful about building trust relationships. Knowledge sharing. Training. 
                * Open-source ethos. Not gate-keeping.
            * Richard
                * When infra becomes visible (e.g. arxive, cloud providers) help transparency narrative.
                * Unwillingness to show warts. Truth about tech debt. Tech debt. Transparency => openness.
                * e.g. low of funds, can help channel financial support, mobilise community
                * Can't try to simply be exchangable / (fungible?) with commercial services. Open source ethos.
* Q - who is legitimised? Who does and doesn't recieve resources? 
        * Rayya
            * Part of our job is to fight imbalance and inequity. 
            * Transitivity. Allow people to build on.
            * 

* What is needed to sustain open infrastructure?
    * Accountability - a need to change the mindset from the provider of services to the consumer of the services, needs to be considered of more of a community tool.

16:36:46 From Ryan McGranaghan (he/him) to Everyone:

in addition (or perhaps an evolution of) the ‘principle of non-discrimination' might be the principle of non-domination ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49414531-difference-without-domination)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49414531-difference-without-domination))

16:37:43 From Angela Okune to Everyone:

I think Lillian is making an important point that infrastructure has multiple layers and goes all the way down.

16:37:54 From Joe Wass to Everyone:

I’d argue that open metadata is a third meaning beyond those two.

16:37:54 From Angela Okune to Everyone:

from standards, to switches, etc.

16:39:14 From Anne Lee Steele to Everyone:

Definitely - it's infrastructure all the way down!

16:45:14 From Joe Wass to Everyone:

If infrastructure is framed as ‘you notice when it goes away’ how do you decide what to build in the first place? Especially in community context.

16:46:49 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

What breakages in open infrastrcuture are not visible? (following up on the notion that Infrastructure is usually only visible when it breaks)

16:48:06 From Sarah Gibson to Everyone:

@Joe I think there's a middle-ground around "it's not gone away but it's not working well either” -> those are the things you prioritise, to improve the experience

16:48:32 From Patricia to Everyone:

The other aspect is "visible to whom"? There are often many pieces that seem broken to the people providing the volunteer labour and everything seems fine to the end user

16:49:02 From Rayya El Zein to Everyone:

^ +1

16:49:02 From Angela Okune to Everyone:

I worry a little about the label of "critical" infrastructure. who does it serve to distinguish between what is "critical" and what is not and who decides. I say this as someone who works on an ethnographic open data platform that quantitative folks would definitely say is not “critical” … 😉 I'm also curious about ideas for funding structures for infrastructure beyond holding out begging bowls to philanthropy and gov’t (which should of course definitely invest heavily in infra.) what other models are possible/being tested?

16:49:04 From Sarah Gibson to Everyone:

To Richard's point about labour, other things you can build is things that reduce the labour. And these don't necessarily have to be automated systems, they can be processes that empower other people to build the thing they need

16:50:00 From Gemma Turon to Everyone:

+1 Angela!

16:54:55 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

@angela I share your concerns about the defining around critical, which is why I think it is important to broaden the conversation about what is important to move the endeavor of science and scholarly research forward, but it's important in a resource constrained environment to have some means by which to compare services to make determinations to best allocate the available resources while encouraging conditions that allow all infrastructure services to flourish.

16:54:56 From Tyson Swetnam (UArizona, CyVerse.org) to Everyone:

our open cyberinfrastructure project (cyverse.org) leadership has always emphasized that we must be investing in “people" and not in "software" or “hardware' -- maintaining our brain trust and a set of strong teams has been critical to keeping our project going.  This means giving our data scientists and software engineers flexibility and providing opportunities for professional development and continuing education. It also means re-building and re-releasing our software every ~5 years as technology evolves and new software languages are embraced. its a Red Queen's Race.

16:56:27 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

In terms of other models, we're working on that as well and have found a lot of inspiration in the utility space. If we think of knowledge as a public good, it follows that the financing mechanisms should (in some way) resemble how we make sure other public goods (water, electricity, etc.) are properly developed, managed, and (importantly) financed.

16:56:50 From Joe Wass to Everyone:

Lost audio?

16:58:18 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

Lillian, you're (unfortunately) help demonstrating the results of systematic underinvestment and poor planning in critical infrastructure services

16:58:44 From Angela Okune to Everyone:

I think to Lillian's point, this is also why governance and funding models, community engagement mechanisms, skills building, etc. need to also be part of thinking about the sociality that shapes and is shaped by technology. An excessive focus on the objects and "hard" infrastructure misses the importance of process and the other more non-material aspects of infrastructure.

16:58:51 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

Thank you Lillian for your participation in this conversation. I'm appreciating your perspective on these issues

17:03:49 From Melissa to Everyone:

re rural areas, certain sections of them might be well served in terms of infrastructure depending on the interests involved. in Brazil there is public and private investment in 5G for agribusiness rural properties, as well as software production hubs around them

17:04:00 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Anne Lee Steele(Direct Message):

Your mic might be rubbing against your clothes

17:04:24 From Sarah Gibson to Everyone:

I’m constantly surprised mybinder.org is still running 😅

17:04:57 From Anne Lee Steele to Malvika Sharan  (she/her)(Direct Message):

Switched my microphone - let me know if it works

17:06:59 From Joe Wass to Everyone:

I’d love to see some comparison to POSI (as others have noted here). It talks about sustainability and open operations.

17:07:16 From Rayya El Zein to Anne Lee Steele(Direct Message):

sorry to turn video off i'm still here

17:07:30 From Anne Lee Steele to Rayya El Zein(Direct Message):

haha i was wondering

17:07:46 From Tyson Swetnam (UArizona, CyVerse.org) to Everyone:

The Quilt gave a great presentation on infrastructure development in the US for the Minority Serving Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (MS-CC) All Hands meeting yesterday: [https://www.thequilt.net/](https://www.thequilt.net/) -- the recording should be online by next week: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gxuEGpxW07lUFD0IEpRQA/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gxuEGpxW07lUFD0IEpRQA/videos)

17:07:58 From Rayya El Zein to Anne Lee Steele(Direct Message):

i don’t have childcare today - reaching Lana's patience threshold

17:08:30 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

It's a tango

17:09:11 From Ryan McGranaghan (he/him) to Everyone:

@Richard, agree with the value in treating knowledge as a public good. That opens up new considerations in governance models and thinking. We can then learn much from natural resource commons. Do you give thought to the concept of the ‘knowledge commons’?

17:10:14 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

We do and we've collaborated with Sam Moore (someone who's thought a lot about the 'commoning' of the research space) on our community governance work that we'll be releasing next week.

17:11:21 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

Ahh yes the care infrastrucuture - so stronngly embedded in open science work. So much emotional labour, both professionally and personally.

17:11:24 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

That speaks to the social aspect and how we align the norms, behaviors, and incentives to match the capacity and potential of the technology

17:11:34 From Ryan McGranaghan (he/him) to Everyone:

we're trying to bring this perspective into the design of NASA infrastructure and resources - would love to learn more from you

17:13:09 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

That would be great Ryan. Please feel free to reach out to me directly and I'd be happy to talk more: richard@investinopen.org

17:14:03 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

So much maintenance work in community driven work. The more we work in this space, the more we realise that research work is such a combination of things we do professionally, and things we do to fix the professional system - care+volunteer labour. That then affects overall how we impact our personal + care responsibility.

17:15:05 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

😄 So many real time infrastructure breakage.

17:16:16 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

yes! Governance. Just plugging Richard’s co-authored part 1 document on community governance: [https://investinopen.org/blog/good-governance-insights-from-nonprofit-literature/](https://investinopen.org/blog/good-governance-insights-from-nonprofit-literature/)

17:18:11 From Angela Okune to Everyone:

sorry to hop off early but thanks for organizing Anne and Rayya and good to see everyone.

17:18:36 From Anne Lee Steele to Everyone:

Thanks so much for joining Angela - your perspective is really appreciated!

17:26:20 From Anne Lee Steele to Everyone:

I worry a little about the label of "critical" infrastructure. who does it serve to distinguish between what is "critical" and what is not and who decides… what other models are possible/being tested?

17:26:56 From Reshama Shaikh to Everyone:

great conversation!  such helpful insights

17:27:02 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

That's again a point on governance - who is in the position of power - who prioritises whose interests.

17:27:03 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

In our Governance Literature Review, we draw on the principal-agent framework to describe this relationship where the community's interest is centered in the work of the organization, who are agents of those interests.

17:27:26 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:

Here's the blogpost on this: [https://investinopen.org/blog/good-governance-insights-from-nonprofit-literature/](https://investinopen.org/blog/good-governance-insights-from-nonprofit-literature/)

17:29:55 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

Aligned with the idea of giving resources that allows consumers to become contributors so they can fix what they need to use. Idealistic, but defnitely a driving factor.

17:30:42 From Rayya El Zein to Everyone:

Many thanks to all for joining, to Anne and Malvika for hosting, and to Sarah and Richard and Lilian for sharing!

17:31:04 From Richard Dunks [IOI] (he/him/his) to Everyone:
