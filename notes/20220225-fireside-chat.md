‚Åâ Open Q & A  

Questions to ask during the session



   * **Questions on career planning**
	   * What has been most important in allowing you to find your way/supporting you in defining your role?
	   * In carving a path for yourself, to what degree do you have to compromise? Whether you make yourself fit into the system or if you're challenging it and if so, how?
	   *  How much of your career to date has been "planned" by you in advance? How did you approach that planning? If you didn't plan, how did you choose your path and/or find your recent roles? 
	   * When there are no clear pathways to development, how do we help ourselves (as a community) to find out what types of learning we need to look out for and produce (or at least sign-post) resources for?
   * **Questions on emergent roles themselves**
	   * What do you think is driving the growing awareness around emergent roles in academia (e.g. HiddenREF, UKRI's 101 roles campaign) 
	   * How would you like to see the field of research infrastructure roles develop in the future? 
   * Which are the most surprising skills you've found useful in your career? 
   * What advice would you give to yourself from 5/10 years ago? 
   * How do institutional leadership build, support and impact the continuously evolving nature of roles in support of research?
   * What options exist for 'open startups' e.g. for emergent infrastructure development not directly fundable ? (ie not attributable to existing application area)
   * Are there opportunities to redesign the organisational model that Academia operates (ie the traditional PIs/researchers/students structure)
   * [from Kirstie] What do the panel members think of changing these roles \_within\_ academia vs \_outside\_ academia? Are there pros and cons of either choice?
   * Lou: I'm curious about the challenges of being a generalist in terms of never being a "deep expert" in any one of the many skills that you may have e.g., using project management or product management methodologies but not as a full time role but one of multiple skills you know how to do. Does this lead to self-doubt, imposter syndrome?
	   * Such an important point about the challenges of being a generalist. 
	   * Noor: to switch topics is an ability in itself!
	   * Arielle: getting to know tons of new fields, and new skills is really important. 
	   * Esther: You don't need to know everything they're doing - you need to know enough to communicate with them. That's moving from data support to software support. If you don't know anything about coding - it's hard to communicate. You don't need to know the details, you need enough to communicate!
	   * @jim: ‚ÄúIf you know what you are doing you probably aren‚Äôt doing research‚Äù (terrible paraphrase of the ‚Äòif you aren‚Äôt confused you aren‚Äôt paying enough attention‚Äô quote)
	   * Bo: What does my imposter syndrome listen to? What makes the doubts go away? Clarity on my sense of purpose. Having collaborators. Be curious about what do your doubts respond to? What makes them a little more quiet? 
	   * @andr√©: I was once told that not knowing anything about the research was a good thing because then I wouldn't make any assumptions... (and that was in line with my role)
   * Cass: In the UK a lot of "post-92" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-1992\_university)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-1992%5C_university)) universities have seperate career tracks for teaching and research faculty, and both culminate in a Professor level. Do we need another split for ~Research Facilitation~ (for example, Community Managers, Data Stewards, Research Software Engineers)? How can these roles be seperated from administrative or professional services roles (for example Human Resources and Finance) for the purposes of defining the "gap" we exist and work in?
	   * There is definately something here on @Bo's comment about not just re-working the "boxes" but thinking where behaviour can be nudged as we identify that the existing boxes are limiting.
   * Andrea: people talk about some "leaking pipeline" but barely talk about how slow this leaking is. Did you have an intuition about the need for such a transition? how early? the fact that this is framed as a negative thing that actually can be liberating made some difference in your decisions?
	   * It's a problem of academy and disservice to people who are important for research shift to more collaborative andd respectful culture. 
	   * I have mixed feelings about the leaky pipeline, or people actively being pushed out of academia: It is great that I currently have a nice job and am happy with live, but I'm pretty certain that there is now at least one PhD candidate under my then supervisor which is not going to have the best time. Again. If we leave fully, we will not affect change and keep the systems continuing as they are... Not sure if there's a solution.
	   * Esther: I have mixed feelings about the leaky pipeline, or people actively being pushed out of academia: It is great that I currently have a nice job and am happy with life, but I'm pretty certain that there is now at least one PhD candidate under my then supervisor which is not going to have the best time. Again. If we leave fully, we will not affect change and keep the systems continuing as they are... Not sure if there's a solution.
   * Question from Andre: Sometimes it feels that the roles emerging are only possible when they avoid embarassing the definition of what a researcher is. One can propose and make it happen as long as reseachers are not disturbed in the way they carry out their work (or in their authority to define what research is). Collaborative research only will happen when this definition is opened up. What does the panel think?
   * Question from Jim: @Beth - is there some kind of signalling pattern between people that allows academics to recognise someone who ‚Äòknows enough‚Äô to bother trying to work with ? 
	   * Talking to pople and inviting them to collaborate - have conversation.
	   * Social media (that is a form of collaboration)
   * Following from @noor‚Äôs comment - mixing the silos - there have been various attempts at social engineering the research environment - I wonder if there has been a systematic review to identify why they succeed/fail ?

## üìù Notes, comments and references by attendees

   * Noor current focus: AI in drug discovery
   * Esther: new roles that are listed as "research support" can limit possibilities if one identifies as researcher (e.g. for funding applications)
   * Bo: Where can ethics in the AI space go wrong? When ethics are caught between different parts of corporate goverance (engineering, product, etc.) Lots of fantastic work being done right now to embed ethics into the lifecycle of AI systems. Other problem I notice on accountability side: accountability actors are often perceives as 'narcs', as out to get us, as antagonists. There is a place for compliance-like and sanctions-like accountability. But what pathways are there to move beyond accountability as antagonistic?
	   * Cool paper that's always on my mind about what failing to truly embed ethics within corporate practices can look like: 
	   * Metcalf, J., Moss, E., & Boyd, D. (2019). Owning Ethics: Corporate Logics, Silicon Valley, and the Institutionalization of Ethics. *Social Research*. [https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Owning-Ethics-PDF-version-2.pdf](https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Owning-Ethics-PDF-version-2.pdf)
	   * Accountability Case Labs project overview: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi-OsM4l2HCn-F0L\_PomqkpncT5y9DCQF6db2eMwsCY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi-OsM4l2HCn-F0L%5C_PomqkpncT5y9DCQF6db2eMwsCY/edit?usp=sharing)
	   \* 

   * Arielle: I think probably one of the biggest ones is actually recognizing the sheer variety of roles to emerge outside of generalist, postdoctoral, or sort of senior fellow positions, where people are having to do a bit of everything on top of producing high quality, original research. 
   * Beth: How do we talk with one another when our understandings of norms are different? Crossing disciplines to have conversations in the field about what roles may be possible
   * Arielle: Example - Product management being applied in the research space.
	   * from chat: (thanks Lou!) So interesting how product management methodology is ending up in multiple places - newsrooms is another place
   * Q: How does career planning work?
	   * Noor: evaluating sense of "contribution", left academia to do a startup. Always have a plan: see where your north star is. See where the world is heading (i.e., and navigate in that direction.
	   * ‚ÄúI always had a plan, but never followed through.‚Äù ‚Äî Noor üôÇ
	   * Research felt like the end of a path (not learning anymore) - moving to a startup was a steep learning curve, but I keep learning.
	   * Esther: Wanted to be an archaeologist! I kind of imagined a researcher to be like an eternal postdoc where you could just do your own research. But no. Roles for data stewards didn't exist previously - but talked to lots of people. Events played a big role. 
	   * Beth: Part of the reason why I didn't have a plan - because these roles didn't exist. The name isn't quite there yet. The jobs emerge - as we see more connections between fields, these jobs emerge.
		   * "how does it work that a position that has only been around for 2 years requires 4 years of experience !!?"
		   * "People who have 'excessive degrees' *have* skills... [go use them] "!
   * Q: What kind of roles need filling?
	   * Bo: We build infrastructure to ensure that pharm. research isn't harmful for people. We try to make sure that these activities aren't harmful / how to avoid harm. Part of the reason why there's so much haze around emerging roles is because of the disruptive role of AI. We have emergent technologies - alongside a lack of infrastructure.
		   * @jim: [following from Bo‚Äôs point] what‚Äôs clear is that the overhead of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù means that coal-face researchers need support (like the stats unit, or the in-house illustrator) to apply the methodologies and ensure safety/ethics
	   * Arielle: Growing sense of recognition for research done with clear frameworks i.e. people who get funding, community managers (who coordinate/collaborate). But collab skills aren't taught - especially within research.
		   * this recognition maybe suggests research *is* getting bettter 
		   * @ andr√©: Sometimes it feels that the roles emerging are only possible when they avoid embarassing the definition of what a researcher is. One can propose and make it happen as long as reseachers are not disturbed in the way they carry out their work (or in their authority to define what research is). Collaborative research only will happen when this definition is opened up. What does the panel think?
		   * Great point. This week I am really enjoying discussions and shared sense of pride that Research Software Engineering has built through the recognition of their work as important part of infrastructure to enable better research.
	   * Bo: Need integration between different techniques. Making expertise understandable, digestible, and actionable between different expert groups. There are likely spaces that need support and help.
	   * Beth: There's lack of understanding of what we need expertise in. Haven't thought about entire bodies of research that exist & can help make that communication happen.
   * Cross-disciplinarity is hard. 
	   * [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6026972](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6026972)
	   * Beth noted: [para] need to recognise that others may have deep expertise/theory on something you see you can just 'do' (ie engineers doing something without considering the contextual work from particular disciplines) (personal note from jim this perfectly describes techbro-ism ;) ) 
   * Question from Andre: Sometimes it feels that the roles emerging are only possible when they avoid embarassing the definition of what a researcher is. One can propose and make it happen as long as reseachers are not disturbed in the way they carry out their work (or in their authority to define what research is). Collaborative research only will happen when this definition is opened up. What does the panel think?
	   * Malvika: Great point. This week I am really enjoying discussions and shared sense of pride that Research Software Engineering has built through the recognition of their work as important part of infrastructure to enable better research.
	   * Kirstie: Andre - can I double check what you mean? I think you're saying that we are making up new jobs so that researchers don't have to change their behaviours, is that right? I agree strongly - I appreciate the different labels because I think they help people to name their expertise and the responsibilities they hold BUT everyone who works with me in TPS **IS** a researcher - they aren't research adjacent, they DO the work of a researcher, just as part of a broad collaboration rather than imagining that all researchers have to be magical unicorns who are great at everything!
	   * Andre: In a way yes, I have seen it many times. Change is acknowledged and researchers admit they need help. But the change and the new roles only go as far as research definition and the definition of what a reseacher is doesn't change. That's what I think is very special about TPS. But organisationally speaking it is harder to effect the same type of change.
	   * Andrea: and a lot of that work was happening magically through unpaid labor
	   * Kirstie: To yes, and your point Andre, I'm curious to know whether researchers can actually \_articulate\_ what a "researcher" actually is! I think it's one of these gut feelings that we have and I think it keeps us locked into the status quo because we don't \_really\_ know exactly what we mean when we say "the role has to change / evolve" unless we interpret that as "just work harder and do more"
	   * Andre: A lot has to do with keeping the authority to define what research is. So change in the role can also threat who defines what research is.
	   * Kirstie: To yes, and your point Andre, I'm curious to know whether researchers can actually \_articulate\_ what a "researcher" actually is! I think it's one of these gut feelings that we have and I think it keeps us locked into the status quo because we don't \_really\_ know exactly what we mean when we say "the role has to change / evolve" unless we interpret that as "just work harder and do more"
	   * Andre: A lot has to do with keeping the authority to define what research is. So change in the role can also threat who defines what research is.
	   * Esther: In my experiences from the Netherlands you're a researcher when you paid to do research. But then researchers do a lot of work unpaid here due to the working pressures, so I find this a terrible definition! I'm still working on a better one though.
	   * Cass: @Esther, perhaps we stop being a (recognised) researcher when we get paid to do the other stuff, and we do the ‚Äúresearch‚Äù as the side job?
		   * Esther: that is what I've been doing indeed... so I still feel like a researcher but get told off sometimes :P
		   * Cass: Like the don‚Äôt know how to measure our value if writing papers is not our primary output, And if they can‚Äôt measure our value, they can‚Äôt value/reward us
		   * Malvika: It is definitely a structural and historical rubrics the many are finding hard to break off from. (Oh you ‚Äònew position‚Äô, don‚Äôt know here you fit in my funding/leadership structure). Totally agree with you Cass and Esther. Hard to establish when people‚Äôs mental model of how researcher looks like or what they have so far rewarded is different from the current reality.
   * Noor: If we focus a lot on like multidisciplinary, bringing all these many people together, and like kind of putting them in an environment that they have to talk to each other.... I think that's very important a lot of researchers got like stuck in in their own kind of research, and they can't really see beyond getting their PhD... helping them to see the possibility of having multidisciplinary applications of  research
   * Esther: increasing flow of information that ensure that everything is working. You only have 40 working hours a week! CM's make sure that people aren't getting burnt out - and that collaborations are happening... But how do we ensure that?
	   * ~~ how to do we recognise CM contribution to the Research output (the paper, etc..)
	   * Such an important point!
	   * Love the way some of the AI community is attempting to re-value stewardship and archival expertise through works like:
		   * Jo, E. S., & Gebru, T. (2020). Lessons from archives: Strategies for collecting sociocultural data in machine learning. *Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency*, 306‚Äì316. [https://doi.org/10/ghn34f](https://doi.org/10/ghn34f)
		   * Famularo, J., Hensellek, B., & Walsh, P. Data Stewardship: A Letter to Computer Vision from Cultural Heritage Studies.pdf. *Google Docs*.

   * Arielle: How do we recognise alternative forms/expressions of value? Emerging roles have a huge effect. 
   * Arielle: Are there other emergent roles?
	   * Beth: There are roles for Assessment and Evaluation - but in different industries, it's often uses a different language to describe these roles + positions. Speaking the language is one of the key pieces of joining any industry outside of academia.
	   * Bo: Armchair exercises to ... 
	   * Beth: How can we create these roles together vs doing it all 
   * Go sign SFDORA ;) [https://sfdora.org/](https://sfdora.org/)
   * HiddenRef: [https://hidden-ref.org/](https://hidden-ref.org/)
   * Bo - how do you discover & learn about alignment between real world needs and (your) expertise - take heed of product thinking: [https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/product-thinking#:~:text=Product%20thinking%2C%20like%20design%20thinking,by%20identifying%20an%20audience](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/product-thinking#:~:text=Product%20thinking%2C%20like%20design%20thinking,by%20identifying%20an%20audience)'s%20problem.
   * Arielle: have become more inclusive of what a researcher is? Not 
   * Esther: Applied to be a main applicant for research, but then told they were in a support role, and needed to find someone else in their role . \<--- !
	   * the bureaucracy needs to catch up with the reality of how the landscape is shifting for definite and to let people lead, actually, because you could argue. that I can contribute to the project, and I can still run it in the background, and someone else can lead it in in name. But that's not the same as actually leading something and actually getting the credit for it and me being promoted in the ends in my own job for having leadership skills and positions, etc.
   * Arielle: Advice for funders?
	   * Bo: How does surprising matchmaking happen?
	   * Beth: How do we assure that these roles are recognised
