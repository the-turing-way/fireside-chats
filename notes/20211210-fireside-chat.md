*Thank you for joining us! We’re delighted to have you here.*



## 🔥 About the Fireside Chat event

*The session chair **Emmy Tsang ****will be joined by **Kate Hertweck, Tiago Lubiana, Humberto Julio Debat ****and **Melissa Mendonça ****to reflect on their experiences from both the grassroots as well as established open research communities. As members of multiple open science and research groups across the Global South and North, they will explore what concerns, values and goals are shared by different communities.This event will invite future discussions on building cross-community collaborations, establishing context-specific support systems and working together towards global sustainability of the open infrastructure.*



Bring along your tea, coffee, snack and questions about The Turing Way. And, while you wait for the event to start - please read more about the chair and speakers here:** **[https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fireside-chat-shared-concerns-in-open-research-communities-tickets-217634158627](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fireside-chat-shared-concerns-in-open-research-communities-tickets-217634158627). 🌻

## ⁉ Open Q \& A for the event hosts 

* **QUESTION for the panel: **Comment from Patricia Logullo:  I agree with Tiago that the access to knowledge is a human right. Especially regarding human health. However, I have been facing situations where the producers of medical devices don't share their code and data because of copyright/patent barriers. They foresee a medical product/device will be commercially available in the future (when properly tested) so they don't share now -- which impairs checking and vetting and reviewing. Can you comment?
    * Sorry about the delay! I'll try to comment whenever we have some time :) - Tiago
    * 

*  Comment from Aricarxiv: in my view it’s a matter of unlearning and easing pressure points. ECRs come into the system with an open mind and intention to share their findings but t
* ** QUESTION for the panel:** Question from Emma Karoune: Do you think funder policies on open access/research, such as in UKRI and ERC, will actually influence the change of research culture? Will it make those that are not adopting these practices want to or need to join in?
*  Comment from Rory: comment to Melissa's point about the difficulty of creating community at particular institutions.  I was going to mention and described the ReproducibiliTEA 'movement' which is helping to enable this kind of community building at many universities here in the UK.
*  Comment from Sara el Gebali: There is something to be said about “standard-templated” code of conducts that don’t take into account divergence, whether it is neurodivergence, cultural, etc… The bigger the community is, the more heterogeneous and you are bound to end up offending someone and conflicts are bound to happen, but having sensible good faith code of conducts that outline just that, coupled with kindness should be a prioritised and not fall into the trap of “I have a COC, now all is well with the world” Rather, what does it promote is more important!
    * Kate: Sara, I absolutely agree with this. I’ve been learning recently about new-to-me communities for which a boilerplate Code of Conduct is mismatched against the surrounding culture. Again, this is more an issue of communication and language than the actual values involved, which hopefully means there are additional templating solutions that can assist!
    * Sara: Kate, the emphasis on values, and it will have to do with the commitment and engagement of the community leader/s as well as looking at who is evaluating code of conduct breaches (diverse committee who can perhaps relate to the issue with empathy). The point I’m trying to make is, it is not a one-size fits all. The landscape of the community will have an impact on the COC which should be a living document as the community grows. 🙂
    * Wolfgang Lukas: Adding to @Sara and related to @Kate and @Tiago: I wonder if rather than thinking of “enforcing” principles, values, codes of conduct, etc., we may emphasize “enacting” them: both in the sense of “putting them into action/practice in ourselves” (being the change, walking the talk) and in the sense of “enaction” as e.g. put forth by Francisco Varela and others: co-creating meaning. It’s a bit difficult to operationalize but can be guided by values/intentions/attitudes such as “kindness” (thanks Sara!) / benevolence, generosity, compassion etc. - so these values, CoC, etc. neither become a boilerplate/token thingy, nor a tool for attacking each other. (Sorry for my rather convoluted expression of this!)
*  Sara: With he Opencider community we realised for LatinAmerica telegram works best, for Africa, Facebook is more a thing, and for many others, Slack and/or element. The solution was bridging between as many as possible channels to collate the conversation

## 📝 Notes and comments by attendees

*  Humberto: Concern - accessibility and human rights in science and education. 
*  Kate: Concerns - respect for decision making in open research. Informing funding for enabling research.
*  Tiago: work with many communities, as leader, organiser, contributor
*  Melissa: working in numpy and python, received funding to improve EDI efforts in these communities
*  Positioning their definition of openness:
    * Kate: It means that information or events are discoverable or find double that people can actually attend or participate in whatever events are happening, or Be able to use whatever information they've been able to find.
    * Tiago: human right of accessing knowledge and doing open research open data, it's trying to ensure that this right, have equal access to knowledge is something that is, not only in theory, but in practice.
    * Humberto: Quoting UNESCO document of open science -  movements and practices surrounding sensitive knowledge to make it accessible available reproducible fair and equal, it has a lot of aspects of it but I like the, the one or the combination of inclusive approaches
    * Melissa: openness is an invitation to participate and support to be able to participate more than access - Inclusion more than access.
    * Emmy: there is alignment of these terms, yet there are layers of knowledge.
* What is closed?
    *  People can't just join project, challenges of working in open, public and making mistakes are imminent
    * There is a steep learning curve when people can get involved.
    * You need training, support and resources to understand the process and truly feel empowered to participate
* We have to learn to balance Openness against rights to privacy, policy
* There is some sense of privilege given to certain people (careerwise, socio-technical situation) to do things openly
* How do we make decision as an organisation: for example, what does participation mean to everyone, what gets merged, what contribution is counted?
    * In many communities, decision making is not dicussed openly, that leads people away
* Discussion on "as open as possible"
    * How to manage information aroung IP, indigenous knowledge, endangered species
* Common kowledge and common culture:
    * People tend to repeat "power culture" - they learn what they see and that can often minimise the local context
    * There is a certain culture around. Open Science communities and how they're supposed to be done. That is also very excluding to some groups of people, and. And so, I wonder, you know, if, if we're sort of stepping on our toes here and, and not doing the thing that we actually want to do which is perhaps what's the other said, just to for people to feel like they can have their own path and shape the way that they want to do science and research or just be in the way that they feel most comfortable.
    * Need of infrastructure support (org, govt)
    * Incentives for open access/research is minimum in some places - it requires hard work to push for behaviour change and to enhance awareness of open research
* "Science progresses one funeral at a time”  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s\_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s\_principle) Hopefully the new generation including us will change this 🙂
* We need to make sure that our practices match our value
* Make expectation explicit, guidelines for interacting with other people, policy should be encforced
* open parctices act as ripple effect - if funders say that they have open mandates for publication, it nudges researchers, that nudges their collaborators, and the next group
* Balancing the action of opening space
* The open hardware discussion reminded me of [https://opentrons.com/](https://opentrons.com/) which has an open hardware model and is having commercial success
* Virtual doesn't mean accessible for everyone.
