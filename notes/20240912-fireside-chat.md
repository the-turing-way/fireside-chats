## Icebreaker

*(Getting to know each other and this Etherpad for collaborative notes)*

**Name / Location you are joining from / Social media (if you'd like to connect with others) /* How would you like your mental health to be supported in academia and academic-adjacent communities?***

*  Gábor Kismihók / Hannover (Germany) /@kismihok / I'd like to have a social space at work with coffee 
* .Alden Conner (she/her) / Oakland, CA / @aldenc.bsky.social / communities that can have real conversations about mental health
* Anne Lee Steele (she/her) / London, UK / @aleestee1e / On one hand, it's tied to supporting better working conditions everywhere (flexibility, security, belonging, manageable workload) - but in academia specifically (as someone that works in a support role) we often talk about: breaking cultures of silence, tying identity to work (leading to overexploitation), insecure grant/funding cycles, and reducing stigma
* Jennifer Bekki (she / her) / Phoenix, AZ, USA / I'd like to have flexibility in "deadlines" when needed
* Mike Nolan (he/him) / Exeter, UK / @\_\_nolski\_\_ / Stability in project funding, employment, \& career. Unionize all academic workplaces, end profit seeking in academia, and guaranteed timely access to long term and preventative healthcare to all
* Aman Goel (he/him) / Manchester, UK / Twitter: @mightaswellcode / Support for neurodivergence and normalisation of mental health days :) +
*  David Sarmiento (he/him)/Edinburgh/Turing/With policies and action (embedded) rather than anecdotal time off
* Danny Garside (they/them) / University of Sussex / mastodon: @da5nsy@social.coop
* Jez Cope (he/him) / South Cambridgeshire / [https://digipres.club/@petrichor](https://digipres.club/@petrichor) / Acknowledge and address systemic issues that cause poor mental health rather that focusing on sticking-plaster individual "solutions" like yoga classes (although I do love a good yoga class)
*  Jim Madge (he/him) / Exeter / @JimMadge (GitHub) @jimmadge@fosstodon.org / Stealing an opinion: address structural issues that harm mental health instead of ignoring them and providing meditation apps
    * Hah, writing almost exactly the same thing at the same time >\_<<3
*  Mary Miedema (she/her) / Montreal, Canada / Policies that support an equitable division of unseen/organizational labour, institution-level conversations to tackle structural issues that cause stress/unsustainable dynamics in academia +
* Alexandra Araujo Alvarez / London, UK / @AlexandraAAJ / only by the fact that people authentically care, that is a lot 
*  Friederike Kohrs (she/her) / Berlin (Germany) / reduce mental health stigma, acknowledge unseen labor, save space at work to share experiences and discuss mental health freely
* Batool Almarzouq / Liverpool / Acknowledge unseen/hidden labor
*  Wendy Ingram/Bradenton, FL (USA)/destigmatize serious mental illnesses like bipolar disorder, major depression and anxiety conditions 
*  
* 



## Open Q \& A  

*The zoom room will remain open from 14 :15- 14:30 UTC+1 for an open Q\&A. This part of the call will not be recorded, and is optional for both speakers and the audience.*

*  
* Wider question for everyone in the room, especially neurodivergent folks - have there been practices in your work that have helped you navigate the day to day?
    * There are some provisions by the university for this, but I'm not even sure what might work / what is needed! (Also doesn't help that the disability support documentation is vague and difficult to locate, ironical to access anyway)
    * Workplaces are sooo bad at this, not from lack of competence or compassion but just because there is very little widely-accepted good practice (until very recently, research has typically focused on children and/or adults with significant co-morbid learning impairments): linking up with fellow neurodivergent people is the only way I've started to understand what things I could ask for
    * Also, here is my very much work-in-progress side project on this subject, which could probably do with more contributors than just me... [https://book.neurospicy.town/](https://book.neurospicy.town/) <3
    * 

* "Wellness" resources and various types of discussion spaces for are often times the general response by institutions to growing severity of mental health among students and workers. These methods seem useful for helping address individualised mental health struggles. However, due to the growth in mental health crisis, it seems the cause is not individuals but systemic exploitation of workers and students to the benefit of the institution. Do these methods of wellness and discussion serve to demobilise demands by students and workers? How do they fit in alongside other demands we are seeing in academia today (i.e. divesting from apartheid).
