## ‚Åâ Open Q \& A  

*The zoom room will remain open from 14 :15- 14:30 UTC+1 for an open Q\&A. This part of the call will not be recorded, and is optional for both speakers and the audience.*



* What open science challenges are not getting enough attention? And what can we do to bring attention?
* I agree that cultural shift is the core of Open Science. The solutions to problems in science are predominantly social. -> response to message addressed durng call

*  let's value the process over the product
* broader perspective on what open science is. Means everyone belongs
* I agree that cultural shift is the core of Open Science. The solutions to problems in science are predominantly social.
* We need to ensure researchers are credited for collaboration and not for competition
* Wow, 8 years after leaving academic science I realize I‚Äôve been taking it for granted that open science goes beyond publication models 
* Ana: People don‚Äôt understand what open science is e.g. "you can‚Äôt have a patent, can‚Äôt have private data" We must explain this well
* From chat

    * UNESCO Open Science [https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science)
    * Important point about policies and research assessment, there should not be a 'tax' on researchers that adopt open practices, which can happen if the only measure for evaluation is journal publications...
    * Yes- I‚Äôve been following these conversations - about the open sci model. In our genomics sphere.. Indigenous Genomic Data Justice for Indigenous Peoples. [https://twitter.com/ScienceisGlobal/status/1653804038025261057](https://twitter.com/ScienceisGlobal/status/1653804038025261057)
    * +1 Ana! Connectivity questions (and the communities that are aiming to bridge the gap) are almost always assumed within computational communities.
    * Chelle: A definition for open science: Open Science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity.

    * I think a great role model of institutional change can be seen in the Helmholtz association (one of the biggest research associations in the world with many research institutions in Germany and beyond). From what I heard their Open Science policy came about by top leadership collaborating with grass roots movements (leaving out the Profs) [https://os.helmholtz.de/en/open-science-in-helmholtz/open-science-policy/](https://os.helmholtz.de/en/open-science-in-helmholtz/open-science-policy/)
