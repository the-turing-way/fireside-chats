## 👋 Icebreaker

*(Getting to know each other and this Etherpad for collaborative notes)*

**Name / City you are joining from / Social media (if you'd like to connect with others) / How does translation and multilingual approaches impact your work/communities you participate in?**

   * Malvika Sharan / London, UK / t @malvikasharan / Translation process have allowed me to connect and learn from different communities. It has enriched my understanding of their need and impact on research loandscape.
   * Anelda van der Walt / Western Cape, South Africa / t @aneldavdw / 
   * Batool Almarzouq/ Saudi Arabia / @batool664 / 
   * Yanina Bellini Saibene / Argentina / t @yabellini / It allows us to be part
   * David Pérez-Suárez / London, UK / 🐦 @dvdgc13 / Translations helps us to reach farther, getting new ideas and different perspectives.
   * Angelique Trusler / Johannesburg, South Africa / @AngeliquePhd /With South Africa having 11 national languages it will help us teach and support more 
   * Sarah Stevens (she/her/hers) / Madison, WI, United States / @microStevens / In a broad way it affects the accessiblity of the various communities I work in, as having materials in only one language is a barrier for individuals to join and particpate in those communities.  This also means the communities in question miss out on including an important diversity of thoughts and perspectives.
   * Camila Rangel Smith (she/her)/ London, Uk/ t: @CamilaRangelS/
   * Jez Cope (he/him) / Yorkshire, UK / 🐦🦊🐙 jezcope / British Library collections include many different languages and scripts, including historical ones, but handwritten text recognition is primarily focused on English/other western languages \& scripts, so transcription of much of this digitised material is challenging
   * Kirstie Whitaker (she/her) / London, UK / t: @kirstie\_j / I care most about translation and multilingual approaches because I worry quite a bit about being really hypocritical!! Like, we say "we want everyonet to feel able to participate" and then quietly whisper (but only if you speak English)!! That's no good!
       * I can only speak English so the other impact is that I'm always completely in awe of everyone working in multiple languages. KUDOS and thank you!
   * Lena Karvovskaya (she/her) /Delft, the Netherlands/@lingdata In my work I have to switch between Dutch and English. It is very difficult sometimes because the language can create a huge barrior for participation. At the same time it's not feasible to do everything in both languages
   * Sarah Gibson / London, UK / t: @drsarahgibson, gh: @sgibson91
   * Ayesha Dunk / London, UK / I studied Thai in my undergrad and spent a year of that studying at a University in Thailand - it was really eye opening living and studying in a country where the language was not my mother tongue. At times, I felt very alone! Translation and multilingual approaches will apply to my work in the training and skills team at the Turing and understanding how best to make what we do as inclusive as possible. 
   * Jennifer Ding (she/her) / London, UK / t: @jen\_gineered / applying non-English language models to "understanding" social media conversation has opened my eyes to how much of the "nautral language translation" challenge is still very much an open problem, especially for Internet lingo like slang/memes
   * Heather Turner (she/her) / Newport, UK / tw: @HeathrTurnr / translation and multilingual approaches enable wider participation in the R community, e.g. in conferences, or websites, in R itself. We had an issue about documentation translation as a possible Google Season of Docs project: [https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/issues/1](https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/issues/1). It was considered to be low priority as Google Translate does a reasonable job (tested by a French speaker). I'd be interested in what other people think - feel free to get in contact or comment on the issue.
   * Kozo Nishida (he/him) / Osaka, Japan / @kozo2 / Japanese people tend to avoid English, and the presence or absence of translation has a great impact on the communication of information.
   * Achintya Rao / Bristol, UK / @RaoOfPhysics
   * Aida Mehonic / London, UK / T: @amehonic / 
   * Piv Gopalasingam (he/him) / Cambridge, UK / Tw: @Cascade21 GH: @PivG / Many bioinformatics trainees + trainers have English as a second/third language, for global bioinformatics training, supporting multilingual training is crucial but capacity to do so within EMBL-EBI requires development. Future positive outcomes? Great bioinformatics/biosci and innovation worldwide, and democratizing science further.. In Latin America we supported work to translate training materials to Spanish, and support delivery in Spanish (or Portuguese, for our train the trainer work).
   * Alejandro Coca / London, UK / t: @alejo\_coca / Democratising open science knowledge and scientific software practices in the environmental science community.  
   * Natalia Morandeira (she/her) / Buenos Aires, Argentina / Tw @Nat\_Mora\_ / Removes language barrier when learning or when reading an article. It's s
   * Anne Treasure / Cape Town, South Africa / @annemtreasure
   * Esther Plomp / Delft, the Netherlands / @PhDtoothFAIRy / The majority of the community does not natively speak English and we have data available in several languages. 
   * Vicky Hellon / London, UK. @vickyhellon 
   * María Nanton / Buenos Aires, Argentina / @bynans1 / Translation lowers the barrier to entry for people who want to enter the data science / analytics field coming from disciplines that are not used to working with English resources. Many of the attendees to our RLadies meetups are beginners or juniors for whom language could be a serious barrier for getting to the adequate resources they need for their career change.
   * Patricia Herterich / Edinburgh, UK / @pherterich
   * Vanessa Vogel-Farley/Wisconsin, US/. translation and multilingual approaches impact my work/communities I participate in by allowing rare disease communities to connect and create data that represents ALL of those affected by that rare disease not just those that are usually represented in research and clinical insights.  Rare disease does not have boarders or a central language which means we need our approaches to not have those either.
   *  Typhaine Paysan-Lafosse (she/her) / Cambridge, UK / @typhainepl / I've done my university studies in France and all the scientific resources were in English, making it difficult for me to understand. As part of my job I give training, atm exclusively in English, I'd like to develop training material in other languages to make it accessible to a wider community.
   *  Rayya El Zein / Philadelphia, USA / @rayelz / 
   * Emilio Mayorga / Seattle, USA /
   *  Cecilia Herbert (she/her) / Buenos Aires, Argentina / @ChuckleScience / Having educational resources in one's own language allows us to focus more on the content than how it is expressed, thus learning better as well as helping to share more easily within local communities (This is part of why we founded Talleres Open Source). In my graduate degree, most of the publishing work I had to do twice since we publish our theses in Spanish but publish papers in English. This is not necessarily taken account as part of the programming/data analysis workflow.

## ⁉ Open Q \& A for the event hosts 

   * Questions covered by the panelists
   *  What can we learn from the humanities, arts, literature, industry or other domains where the translation or multilingual practices are more mature? You can give either a positive or not so positive example/experience. 
       * 

   * **Question for David:** What are different aspects of translation and can you mention some related challenges you have faced and how you have address them? (thinking about internationalisation vs localisation) 
   * 

   * **QUESTION for the panel: **
   *  
   * For collaborations on Spanish materials (translations or new materials) involving volunteer contributors from different countries, how do you make localization decisions when contributors' time/bandwidth is limited and you're trying to maximize your audience? I imagine there are similar challenges with other multi-national languages like Arabic.

## 📝 Notes and comments by attendees

   * What can we learn from the humanities, arts, literature, industry or other domains where the translation or multilingual practices are more mature? You can give either a positive or not so positive example/experience.
   *  Multilingual experiences
       * signs in multiple languages
       * repeated TV programme in different language on different days
   * What are different aspects of translation and can you mention some related challenges you have faced and how you have address them? (thinking about internationalisation vs localisation)
       * not all translations are exactly the same as the source - e.g. wikipedia pages. Sometimes the translations can be better than the original.
           * e.g. [https://www.wired.com/2016/10/wired-book-club-ken-liu-interview/](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/wired-book-club-ken-liu-interview/)
       * think about organisation - which language are you going to use, how you're going to work, etc
       * localisation vs just straight translation of 
   * Yani: you can't just take the words and translate word for word. There are different "flavours" for each language. Have to decide which flavour will be used. How to translate technical terms consistantly. How to handle gender. Especially for languages where words are not gender neutral. Also gender neutral language. Not just words either, need to translate diagrams etc.
       * Here is some info from one of the projects Yani was involved in: [https://github.com/gvwilson/teachtogether.tech](https://github.com/gvwilson/teachtogether.tech)
       * Here are the guide of the translation (in Spanish): [https://github.com/gvwilson/teachtogether.tech/blob/main/es/README.md](https://github.com/gvwilson/teachtogether.tech/blob/main/es/README.md)
   * Natalia: Figures and their alt-text
   * Bobby: some English words do not exist at all in other languages and vice versa.
   * Yani: making the text more relatable by changing the names to local names, using local cities, local literature, etc in examples. Can end up feeding back improvements to the original text, as really get to the bottom of what the author meant.
   * Camila: can be hard for collaboratively written text like the Turing Way - don't have one author to refer to, to understand how to translate effectively.
   * Batool: most tools do not support non-Latin script or languages that are read right-to-left (RTL)
      Carpentries' Glosario: [https://glosario.carpentries.org/](https://glosario.carpentries.org/)

   * Low-resource languages
   * Knowledge Equity Lab podcast: Knowledge by Whom? Knowledge for Whom? [https://knowledgeequitylab.ca/podcast/ep1/](https://knowledgeequitylab.ca/podcast/ep1/)
   * Camila: automatic machine translation is biased, but gets information out; human translation and review is better, but can stop information flow
   * Yani: need people for localization even if automatic translation gets better, especially for teaching. Paying people would help!
   * Malvika: need diversity in the room - sometimes a localization (e.g. changing to local newspaper) may seem a good idea, but might not be received well!
   * Yani: need translation from non-English languages to English as well, non-English speakers have a lot of knowledge to share.
   * Bobby: need user-friendly apps for translation (avoiding programming syntax/markup)
   * Batool: labour needs to be acknowledged, e.g. having to produce material twice in own language and in English.
   * David: embedding multilanguage culture from the beginning, early in children's lives.
   * Camila: large language models should not be in the hands of big companies
   * Anelda: organizations and companies should use the expertise of people wih lived experience
