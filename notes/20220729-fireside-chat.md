## ⁉ Open Q \& A  

* What challenges has scaling posed for your community?
* What tactics or tools have you applied to make that scaling more equitable?
    * Are there approaches you are considering but have not yet tried? 
* Who or what influences your approach to questions of scale and sustainability in your community? 
* What does the future hold for your community? How do you hope to navigate ‘scale’ going into the future?
* How do you track/understand a community of communities? How do you improve connection between them and attempt to identify where connections are not present or robust? 
* When do you intentionally move away from growth/scaling for the sake of improving culture/relationality in a community? 
* How do you network to grow your communities internationaly? Specially with underrepresented communities?
*

* Alycia Crall:
    * Alycia advertised Carpentries annual meeting: [https://2022.carpentrycon.org/schedule/](https://2022.carpentrycon.org/schedule/)
    * Communities have emerged organically but no formal structures to help develop them 
* Geoffrey Kateregga:
    * Geoffrey - setting up communities is easy compared to the effort needed to sustain them e.g. governance 
* Patrick Mineault:
    * [https://academy.neuromatch.io/](https://academy.neuromatch.io/)
    * Building and growing communities from scratch rapidly 
* Sele:
    * Built a community for women and non-binary participants in OpenStreetMap (GeoChicas) 
* **What challenges has scaling posed for your community? **
    * PM: at peak onboarding 10 volunteers a day - how do you maintain culture and establish norms when growing that fast? 
    * Asked about CoC - didn't have time to create but watched a talk (link pls) about culture creation - it's important to be intentional and set expectations and boundaries on behaviour 
        * The Hard Parts of Open Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o\_4EX4dPppA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o\_4EX4dPppA)
    * Having nice bots is great but events for new volunteers really helps with retention and to stop people getting lost in community spaces 
        * *RIP GreetBot: *[https://medium.com/greetbot-blog/after-5-million-hellos-its-time-to-say-goodbye-8b82e40b5701](*https://medium.com/greetbot-blog/after-5-million-hellos-its-time-to-say-goodbye-8b82e40b5701*)
    * S: whenver groups talk about creating these types of documents, there's always a backlash against inconvenience but usually provides the answer to "why do you need a CoC?"
    * GK: OpenStreetMap is a community of communities, lots of different cultures and communities and it's hard to find an overarching document/process that covers all the different backgrounds in a global community 
    * S: for events I recommend checking this badging project from the CHAOSS community to create more welcoming events (mostly in person). [https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/)
    * KH (from Chat): I've been learning about other ways to frame a code of conduct (since that label feels punitive and police-like to some folks). I wonder if the same push back would occur if it was framed as “norms of coexistence” or “group agreements”? Does anyone have experience with this?
    * AC: We've grown so rapidly so we don't even have a good sense of who our subcommunities are and who leads them 
* **What tactics or tools have you applied to make that scaling more equitable?**
    * S - hard to find a single tech tool that works for all, but also important to understand how to create bridges to other existing groups as well 
    * AC: Issues with tools e.g. Slacks archiving messages older than 90 days which will cause issues for subcommunities that aren't tied into the Carpentries ecosystem 
    * S: mapping our subcommunities is a big project
    * PM: paid vs unpaid work - discussions work with small groups but in larger communities this can be a very long discussive process 
        * Tools - people don't understand timezones! It's hard to sort out so we did find tools to help 
* From 'code of conduct' -> 'norms of coexistence' (Kate)
    * Ryan: I like the concept of ‘norms of coexistence' - reminded me of Danielle Allen's book ‘Difference without Domination' which explores these norms for holding difference to improve our democracy ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49414531-difference-without-domination)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49414531-difference-without-domination))
* S: paid vs unpaid work - "meritocracies" but woman are already doing the "second shift" in unpaid housework and childcare which makes it harder to build the credibility and create space for expertise
* Point on "community housekeeping" work also going unrecognised despite being critical to maintain and build communities 
* GK: trying to decentralise hubs to help promote regional equity and help to contextualise tools  
* AS: Related to paid vs unpaid - TPS programme is incubating and supporting people to work on Turing Way as part of their day job.. BUT Tyranny of Structurelessness - emergence of elites who can limit the participation of new members, even unintentionally
* GK: important to acknowledge volunteers unpaid time and give them feedback - tell people how their work has changed/contributed to the project 
* [https://www.localizationlab.org/](https://www.localizationlab.org/)
* I've found this resource valuable re: governance: [https://communityrule.info/](https://communityrule.info/)
* From Ryan McGranaghan: would love to share more about how we're doing it (either here or in a longer form forum). At a high level, it is a matter of working with the communities (a kind of ethnographic approach) to learn what questions they are constantly asking about the community and then structuring the data that are available about a community (collected in numerous ways) so that they are searchable and navigable. Importantly, this structure is continually evolving by the community (a concept we think of as a knowledge commons [https://knowledgestructure.pubpub.org/pub/space-knowledge-commons)](https://knowledgestructure.pubpub.org/pub/space-knowledge-commons))
* Healthy code review /feedback culture: [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Guidelines\_for\_a\_healthy\_code\_review\_culture](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Guidelines\_for\_a\_healthy\_code\_review\_culture)
* MS: In Open Life Science we have managed to pay all our mentors, facilitators, volunteers, participants through honoraria, microgrants and hourly fees. We still need to publish our report for this year, but you can read a bit on how we started: [https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/11/23/micro-grants-in-2021-ols-3-ols-4/](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/11/23/micro-grants-in-2021-ols-3-ols-4/). I also learned that this has been harder in Large org with admin costs and overheads.
* ASP: We just published a ten simple rules paper to host inclusive conferences, [https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010164](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010164) and NUMFOCUS has this cookbook [https://discover-cookbook.numfocus.org/](https://discover-cookbook.numfocus.org/)
