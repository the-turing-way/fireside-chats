## 🔥 About the Fireside Chat event

At this inaugural event, Cassandra D. Gould van Praag, a contributor and community member of The Turing Way will be joined by the project lead Kirstie Whitaker and senior researcher Malvika Sharan to catalyse informal chat and discussion about The Turing Way's history, vision and goals in the context of research reproducibility.

## ⁉ Open Q \& A for the event hosts 

*  If you were to start your journey with TTW now, what, if anything would you do differently? 
*  When I'm looking at TTW, I got the impression of TTW is Statistic and R-centric. What do you think about this?
      * Kirstie: Just in case we don't get to this question - I've also heard that it is too Python centric! So I think that's likely the fact that different parts of the books are written by different people and with different focuses. Definitely a great way to harmonise across languages.
         * I'd be curious to know a little more about what you mean by statistic centric - we're aimed at supporting data scientists so we'll have a good amount of statistics in there, but I'm curious to know what you think is \_missing\_ from the over focus on statistics?
         * Radif: Yes, one of this assumption is caused by the people in TTW. Also maybe the job vacancies in TTW is require the applicant to have background in stats/data science. Oh I'm a Python programmer BTW :D
         * Ah, one more thing. Rmarkdown! this is one of the other reason. I just knew about Rmarkdown thanks to TTW.
         * (It may be that there are lots of chapters that don't exist yet!)
         * OK, I'll look forward to that :)
*  A really specific thing: I think github is an amazing tool for this type of open work but I worry about the de facto monopoly it now has on Open Everything ... and I don't know how to address this worry because it seems like everyone else who shares this worry also has that techbro mindset of valorising tools that are difficult to use, so I guess my question is how can we diversify the tools that people use without making it into a big "you should suffer for your art" thing? +1
      * Kirstie: I think this is a GREAT question. I think this is probably one of the very few decisions that I have made that isn't "boiling the ocean" - we could mirror to GitLab?? We could have multiple options?? That would be too much work at this point.
         * I have said to Malvika before that I think there will be a moment when the community says: We need to switch away from GitHub. When we hit that moment then we'll switch.
         * I like GitHub because that's where the majority of projects are.... but at some point we're going to need to take responsiblity (and the hit on discoverability) and follow our values. I don't know when to time that.... but the conversation needs to keep happening :) 
*  Meta Q: Will this Etherpad be archived and if so could you link to the archived version from the YouTube video when up?
      * Kirstie: Probably not with the names? But hopefully with the questions?
         * That would be ace! :) – Achintya

## Feedback

What worked?

*  Loved the informal chatting!
*  
What didn’t work?

* Not sure, if I missed it - I was missing a couple of sentences about what the TW book concretely is about, maybe outline the chapters or something like that (but I caught up by quickly looking at the github repo ;))
* 

What would you change?

* Would encourage more introductions of the attendees 
* 

What surprised you?

* How entertaining it was, it didn't feel like an hour
*
