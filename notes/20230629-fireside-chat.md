## ‚Åâ Open Q \& A  

*The zoom room will remain open from 14 :15- 14:30 UTC+1 for an open Q\&A. This part of the call will not be recorded, and is optional for both speakers and the audience.*

* How do we get people to care? other than as a requirement, too often a tick box nod
* How can we hold critique and solutions together in addressing these questions?
* What's the concrete action to tackle some of this? What are lobbying efforts to get politicians to tackle some of this that we should get behind?
