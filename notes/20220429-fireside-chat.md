* Lilly
* Lilly: as csvconf organizers, we wrote a blog post in 2020 about how we moved from in-person to virtual: [https://csvconf.com/2020/going-online/](https://csvconf.com/2020/going-online/) (sorry for messing with your notes Yani (I'm asuming this is Yani?)) - je, nop, I think my note are ok :-)
* Dorothea  spoke about her attendance at useR - useR! 2021 website: [https://user2021.r-project.org/](https://user2021.r-project.org/)
* Gilbert - DataFest Africa - 2021 was a hybrid event. He will be talking about this event as well as ommunities that have low internet speeds.  


Question 1: What do we mean by inclusive conferences? What aspects are important to keep in mind?

* BK - very broad question - high level - think about where people are coming from. Children at home but also that may be difficult for some people if they need to look after them. Going to conferences is important for networking, career progression. Important for Early Career Researchers. Need to make it inclusive - code of conduct, pacman rule, making sure that everyone is included in chats. But alos thinking about computer bandwidth.
    * difference betwee experiences of those that are introverts and those that are extroverts. Introverts - easier to interact online. 
    * Are you looking to attract a particular audience? timezone
* Dorothea - we thought about this at the beginning of our organisation. We tried to make the conference as accessible as possible for the most people possible but there will be tade off. Have a mixed team for organisation of the event to bring these different aspects to the planning. 
* Elio - Must keep in mind, how you can measure the inclusivity of your conference. Numbers are good but need to measure the quality of the conference. 
* From Saranjeet: In one of the Code for Science \& Society sessions, I really liked when the session facilitator said that: "If you tend to speak more, make space; and if you tend to speak less, take space"


Question 2 - What drove your organisation’s decision to return to in-person conferencing? What trade-offs are involved in doing so? 

* Lilly - csv conf is taking a break this year but planning for in person next year. Why? we want to meet people, we all miss networking with everyone. This conference is good at creating a local community - it brings in a lot of local data makers and community so this is difficult to replicate online. But the local community is important for the conference. 
    * also we have a Llamha that you can pet.
    * Online conferences are hard - takes more organisers to do it well. 
    * we also wanted to travel somewhere new. We want to grow our community so we can expand it for our in person event. 
* Andrea: there is this great resource about inclusive conferences by NUMFOCUS: [https://discover-cookbook.numfocus.org/](https://discover-cookbook.numfocus.org/)  and we at useR! 2021/useR! Working Group are writing a knowledgebase for future editions: [https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/main/](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/main/) (it's super WIP!)
* What does it mean to be in person? Gilbert - we are currently hosting an in person event for our team. It creates a bond for the team to really get to know each other. Remote gives the flexibility for working at different times. You can interact with more diverse groups and is more accessible for some. Like I would not be able to attend thihs event if it was in person because of the visas, etc.
* Lilly - recently attended an in person event for work and people were so happy to be there and see each other.  
* Anne - online sometimes brings you into closer contact with different people - it can have ECRs with very well known scientists. 
* 

Questions 3 - Similarly, what are the trade-offs involved in the online-format?

* Dorothea - in-person - you have one timezone and this makes it easier. A local conference can be in one timezone but international online needs to be in multiple. 
    * Need to try harder with online to block the time to spend at the conference. In person - you are there so you attend.  
* when going online - don't need to keep the same style of conference. Re-think it and decide what will be good or not online. Think about who will now attend or not. 
    * Online can be more inclusive - such as asking questions can be easier for ECRs. 
    * online - it is hard to get people to pay but we still need money for an online platform and for transciption services. May be hard to keep the sponsors.
* Elio - problem with online conferences may be cultural - people not blocking their time. This will change and they will realise how to organise their time. 
* Ben - it will improve! We are in the early stages and I think in 50 years we will see great things. 


Question 4 - What are the trade-offs in planning hybrid conferences, and how have you worked to mitigate them in your event planning?

* Gilbert - a lot of you come from places where accessibility to the internet and power is not a problem. Covid has exposed the differences between Global South and North. The hybrid is the best option for us. 
    * It might be like hosting two events at the same time - you odn't want this. Don't want the programmes to clash. 
    * Need facilitators to interact with both online and offline.  Need a lot of prep between the facilitators. 
    * how do you make sure that the online partcipants keep focused and involved - shared docs can help with this. facilitators can read out docs, questions.
    * Social media can be used to get engagement between participants - make a special hashtag.
    * Rights con has side rooms that you can network virtually - this is what you would get in a physical conference and this is the virtual version. 
* Lilly - can you tell us more about those online networking rooms? did you have some questions to lead with. 
    * we make it informal - we make it with funders or local organisations. 
    * identify people that are beyond what has alrady been discussed in the conference.
* Anne - Hub format - what do you all think about the hub format? has anyone experienced this? 
    * Ben - It is exciting - you get a good mix of the two main types of conferences. You are meeting people and not travelling far so better for environmental reasons.
    * But it will be a lot of work for organisers. 
* Lilly - it might make it more inequitable.
* Dorothea - it might work for getting people to places of good internet connections. BUt I think the link up between those in the hub and those online could be difficult. 
* Gilbert - the hubs could be good to bring conferences to people. 


* What role does funding play within this debate?
* Ben - hybrid is seen as running two events so double the cost.
* Lilly - I like the idea of asking a university for a free space. 
* Dorothea - what can you offer sponsors online? maybe sponsor booths, or lightning talks before the keynote speakers.
    * what do you offer scholarships for online conferences? accessibility costs, childcare.

Ben - what is it that we are missing with online conferences? Is it the shaking of hands? It might be time - giving time to the conference.

As someone who hates networking at events - I do not miss it 😬 Really dreading that part when I ever have to do an in person event again

16:38:43 From Anne Lee Steele to Everyone:

Pad for people joining in: [https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ttw-fireside-chat-apr2022](https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ttw-fireside-chat-apr2022)

16:40:26 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

hehe @patricia I definitely relate to that! Though I think I actually like it better in person that online 😂

16:40:37 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

than* online

16:41:18 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

me too. I have been to work in peson 3 times this year and I always end feeling energised by interactions I have with folks I would otherwise not meet. Though of course large events could be different.

16:43:35 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

As for travelling, in my experience, the processes around visas and international travel have become really really tricky and complex -- more than they have been historically. The processes are more biased in a way that they are time and energy consuming, more so in the parts of world that are underrepresented at international events (speaking for India)

16:43:54 From Elio Campitelli to Everyone:

+1 Saranjeet.

16:43:58 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

I agree with you Saranjeet

16:44:10 From Batool Almarzouq to Everyone:

+1 Saranjeet

16:44:12 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

yes! great point. We’re doing a company all-hands gathering, and it was really difficult to find a place that would accept everyone’s vaccines

16:45:02 From Elio Campitelli to Everyone:

I curently have a first-row seat to my girlfriend trying to get a USA visa to go to a conference and it's exhausing, expensive and success is not guarandeed.

16:45:03 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

To attend any international conference we did not have funding and the visa process only made it more expensive.

16:45:16 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

+1 Dorothea!!! :-)

16:45:58 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

and, as an American, I have NO idea how to help with US visas. It is so complicated that organizers often can’t help!

16:46:32 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

For those of us who don't have the resources, the feeling that, again, you're not going to be part of it is very frustrating.

16:46:48 From Irene Ramos to Everyone:

+1 Andrea, Yani

16:47:50 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

Also, as an early career person who graduated through the pandemic, I don't really have any exposure to what an in-person international looks like or feels like. But with the discussions around getting back in person, I really have the FOMO, and also the feeling that the resources and knowledge won't reach me easily anymore

16:48:05 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

international event*

16:48:15 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

We are going to test a format with small local hubs and Zoom for hubs to meet. Mozilla Global Sprint is the inspiration that seemed to have worked really well.

16:48:32 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

(this for the Book Dash in May hopefully)

16:48:43 From Christina Koch to Everyone:

I really like the idea of hubs; doing local in-person events and then connecting them online.

16:48:56 From Diego García Gálvez. to Everyone:

Interesting about that Test.

16:49:07 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

❣️ the small local hubs! +1 Malvika

16:49:09 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

Yes 🙂 People can still have meals with each other. That I think I can't replace.

16:49:37 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

accessibility!

16:50:31 From Rachael Ainsworth to Everyone:

A lot of organisations who typically sponsor events have also had their budgets slashed.

16:50:34 From Ben Krikler to Everyone:

I also really like the idea of hubs. I'm very curious to see how this evolves in the future. It can also help the time-blocking aspect "I can't join your meeting cause I'm not in the office"

16:50:38 From elisee jafsia to Everyone:

Beautiful  idea for the small local hubs

16:52:09 From Patricia Herterich to Everyone:

People also multi-tasked in in-person events, I doubt that they were there for the event all the time they were physically in the space

16:52:17 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

when I read/talk to in-person organizers of other useR! editions they agree that venue securing and catering (inclusive food practices) were also extremely hard.

16:52:57 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

Ahh yes Elio. I am so glad to know so many people online that I could never meet orherwise <3

16:54:28 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

+1

16:55:02 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

I have to travel to Portugal in July, the flight is four times my monthly salary.  There is no way I can pay for it.

16:55:18 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

holy moly Yani!!!

16:55:29 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

😫

16:55:42 From Rachael Ainsworth to Everyone:

+100 Ben

16:55:51 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

that is painful Yani! 😞

16:55:57 From Elio Campitelli to Everyone:

Same here, to Reading.

16:56:30 From Elio Campitelli to Everyone:

Great analogy!

16:57:36 From Patricia Herterich to Everyone:

Oh my, please let's not ever go back to people not properly using the mic in in-person conference rooms 😒

16:58:11 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

+100

16:58:16 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

+1 Dorothea!

16:58:16 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

that’s a super powerful point Dorothea

16:58:19 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

back to normal is back to not being there

16:58:26 From Rachael Ainsworth to Everyone:

💯

16:58:54 From Elio Campitelli to Everyone:

+1 you always need to ask "wha'ts the alternative?"

16:58:58 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

maybe a follow up blog that has a matrix?

16:59:10 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

+1

16:59:12 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

Also the conference organizers usually ask for booking 'fully refundable' tickets -- which are even more expensive. Even though the costs are reimbursed -- it is not at all easy for everybody to afford those ticket costs

17:00:52 From Katie Pratt to Everyone:

For anyone interested in continuing the conversation and co-creating a couple of virtual events resources, CSCCE’s May community call (18 May at 3pm UTC) will be focusing on virtual (and hybrid) gatherings. More info is here: [https://www.cscce.org/2022/04/04/community-calls-coming-up-in-q2-of-2022/](https://www.cscce.org/2022/04/04/community-calls-coming-up-in-q2-of-2022/)

17:03:09 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

I have run a few hybrid events recently, completely agree on Gilbert’s recommendation on having multiple facilitators. For one event we did not enough facilitators that end up making online folks confused.

17:06:19 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

yes, it gets really confusing!

17:11:03 From Georgia Aitkenhead to Everyone:

I’m going to have to head. Thanks for a fascinating discussion!

17:11:43 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

For remote/hybrid conferences and longer running workshops/events, I feel it would really help if we think about providing co-working spaces to the attendees for the duration of the event. Having a proper space and desk from where one can attend and properly concentrate on the event might help people. Although co-working spaces may not be present in all parts of the world, but where they do they can turn out to be helpful -- usually co-working spaces also have stable internet connectivity

17:12:09 From Ben Krikler to Everyone:

+1 Saranjeet. Co-working and even university spaces could play a very big role in the sort of hub format

17:12:33 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

oh a coworking space is a good idea!

17:13:30 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

I love that idea Saranjeet, although co-working spaces are not super frequent, you could ask the closest university/library to help by lending a room and their internet connection.

17:15:11 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

yes, libraries! Here in India, we also have 'Abhyasikas' in Universities and also in localities-- which are communal spaces for students to be able to study and concentrate

17:15:26 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

<3

17:15:30 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

(note for myself and hopefully interesting for others) For people creating conference budgets: It seems like asking universities for free/low cost rooms (with internet as Andrea noted!) would be a good idea for hubs/hybrid options

17:16:03 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

Usually, in Argentina, you organize conferences with a university always

17:16:23 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

And our most great universities are free and public

17:16:25 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

:-)

17:16:58 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

useR! is writing a Knowledge base, @andrea one of the writers is here!!

[https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/main/](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/main/)

17:17:00 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

amazing! so smart

17:17:57 From Katie Pratt to Everyone:

Thanks all, this was a really great conversation! 👋🏻

17:18:41 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

That is so wrong!!

17:19:09 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

Thank Yani! the knowledgebase is very WIP right now but has inputs by Dorothea and Yani here (and many other useR! 2021 organizers)

17:21:04 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

The other thing to ask from the institutions is protected time from the people who organize.

17:21:20 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

+1

17:21:27 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

ASL interpreters for US-based conferences, for example

17:21:31 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

My institution sponsored useR! and I was able to use time from work for the organization.

17:22:18 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

They don't give money, but give human resources.

17:22:42 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

The pet of the conference was made by the ilustrator of my research team, for example

17:22:56 From Saranjeet Kaur to Everyone:

got to drop now! brilliant discussion this has been!

17:23:56 From Dorothea Hug Peter to Everyone:

17:24:24 From Malvika Sharan  (she/her) to Everyone:

[https://www.sli.do/](https://www.sli.do/) is what Elio mentioned

17:25:03 From Ben Krikler to Everyone:

I'm going to drop the link to our online event networking tool because I really think it addresses some of what people have said about online and I'd love to get your feedback: [https://remotely.green](https://remotely.green)

17:25:48 From Dorothea Hug Peter to Everyone:

we streamed to YouTube because it can be easier in terms of internet connection bandwidth.

17:28:17 From elio to Everyone:

So cuuuuuteeeee

17:28:41 From Patricia Herterich to Everyone:

curious to know how many people put an Out of office on for online conferences...

17:28:54 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

Nice question Patricia

17:29:08 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

I didn’t realize my hand was up 😂

17:29:20 From Dorothea Hug Peter to Everyone:

haha, I think that percentage is really low Patricia

17:29:48 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

+1 I think I have blocked time on my calendar for an online conf just once in the last 2+ years…

17:29:48 From Ben Krikler to Everyone:

When I remember it I do set an automatic email reminder and also set my slack / mattermost status

17:30:39 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

I block my calendar to not have other meetings

17:31:51 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

love that “the weird one will be to travel”

17:32:04 From elio to Everyone:

Me too. I enter "conference mode" and do no work outside the confernece.

17:32:38 From Yani Bellini Saibene (she/her) to Everyone:

+1 Dorothea!

17:33:19 From Batool Almarzouq to Everyone:

Thank you for the speakers and organisers for an awesome Fireside Chat session!

17:33:21 From Lilly Winfree to Everyone:

17:33:39 From Andrea Sánchez-Tapia to Everyone:

thank you all! great conversation

I’m totally going to play around with it Ben!
