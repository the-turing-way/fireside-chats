## Introduction Script (2025-current)

We are recording this session with transcriptions and it will be uploaded to Youtube afterwards. If you do not want to be on the video, please turn off your camera now. 

[ Start recording ] - Pinning folks’ videos here. 

Welcome everyone to this month's Fireside Chat hosted by The Turing Way.

My name is [XXX]. I’m the [XXX] for the Turing Way - I’ll be kicking off this session to tell you a little bit more about this call, before passing the mic to XXX, my colleague and XXX of the project, to take it away for this [MONTH] [YEAR] fireside chat.

A few words about The Turing Way, it is an open source, open collaboration and community-developed handbook on data science.  Our goal is to make reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science possible - and to make it both accessible and comprehensible for everyone. While I am kicking off the session today – I’m part of a wider team that includes XXX and others, many of which are here, and represent the wider & international community of researchers who have created this shared resource. They themselves bring perspectives from their fields, countries, backgrounds, and lived experiences.

This Fireside Chat series itself has been an effort towards creating space across the open science communities - and indeed, the wider open ecosystem where people can gather and exchange concerns, explore challenges and share different practices that work in their contexts, to build allyship, and understand each other’s work and perspectives just a little bit better. 

With this being said - I’m really excited about this month’s topic: XXX, which XXX.

A few housekeeping things before we get started: 

Please note that we have a shared Etherpad to facilitate written note-taking and invite ideas from you, who have joined to listen in. Please feel free to add questions and notes to the pad or the chat, and we’ll make sure to post them to be used after.

We have a code of conduct that applies to this event to ensure accessibility and respectful collaboration. For any concerns, reporting of an incident that makes you feel uncomfortable at this call or further ideas to improve accessibility, please email theturingway@gmail.com. You can directly reach out to me or Malvika, by emailing to their private email, information for which is provided in the Etherpad.

Just a reminder, but we will be holding the Zoom room open for an additional 30 minutes - for an unrecorded, open discussion. It is completely optional – but it is when we are able to turn off the recordings and ask questions of each other and ourselves in a perhaps less formal space than this one. It usually ends up being a very interesting conversation.

[ Script to hand=out] With that, I am really delighted to hand it over to [NAME] to kick off today's session.

We are hosted by but not exclusive to – The Alan Turing Institute, which is the UK’s national centre for data science and artificial intelligence. Our project is located in the Tools, Practices, and Systems programme, which we will link in the chat. The TPS programme helps to strategise and implement open infrastructure within the Institute across various areas of research within the Turing and nationally across the UK.
