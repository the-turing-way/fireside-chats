## Invitation to speakers 1

Dear [NAME],
 
I hope this email finds you in good health. üòä We would like to invite you to speak at The Turing Way‚Äôs fireside chat on [DATE], co-developed & co-hosted with [ORGANISATION].
 
[NAME] and I are planning this event around the idea of ‚Äúnavigating scale within open communities‚Äù, and talking through the challenges, questions and trade-offs that may emerge along the way.
 
Given your [ CONTEXT ] ‚Äì we believe that it is crucial to involve your experiences and expertise in this conversation. We would welcome your input, and think our audience has much to learn from your experiences and expertise. 
 
A bit more about the Fireside chats themselves:
 
The Turing Way Fireside chat series was launched in 2021 to engage with The Turing Way community and members in other open science communities with shared interests and goals in data science and research. We aim to feature experts, champions and their projects from across different international communities in reproducibility, open research, ethics, collaboration and everything in between. This event is still under development, but the main goal for us is to engage people across communities to build explicit connections, identify resources, build collaboration and connect on shared issues and contextual solutions in Open Science. You can see details from the previous Fireside chat here: https://hackmd.io/@turingway/fireside-chats.
  
Please let me know if you have any questions, and if you would be interested in joining us later this month. Looking forward to hearing from you, and happy to jump on a short call to talk more about the event in detail. 
 
Best,
[NAME]
